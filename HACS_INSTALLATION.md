## Usage

Once configured, NetworkNest will create several sensors:

- `sensor.connected_devices` - Number of connected devices
- `sensor.network_status` - Network connectivity status
- `sensor.network_uptime` - Network uptime in hours

### Creating Automations

You can use these sensors in automations. For example:

```yaml
# Alert when network is down
automation:
  - alias: "Network Down Alert"
    trigger:
      - platform: state
        entity_id: sensor.network_status
        to: "offline"
    action:
      - service: notify.mobile_app_your_phone
        data:
          message: "Network is down!"
```

### Dashboard Cards

Add network monitoring cards to your dashboard:

```yaml
# Bandwidth gauge
type: gauge
entity: sensor.network_bandwidth
name: Network Speed
unit: Mbps
min: 0
max: 1000

# Connected devices
type: entity
entity: sensor.connected_devices
name: Connected Devices
icon: mdi:devices
```

## Web Dashboard

Access the full NetworkNest web dashboard at your deployed URL for:

- Real-time 3D network visualization
- Detailed monitoring history
- Device management
- Advanced configuration options
